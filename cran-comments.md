This is a resubmission of the first submission of this package following feedback from Uwe Ligges.

The feedback was to correct the Description in the DESCRIPTION file. This is done now.
Also Uwe questioned why so many of the examples were surrounded by "dontrun{}". I have now added all of these examples to test-examples.R so they are tested.

This package allows users to easily recreate visualisations seen on the [Fingertips tool](http://fingertips.phe.org.uk) that is made available by Public Health England.
